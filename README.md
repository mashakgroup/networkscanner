# networkscanner
Pattern Detection: The script scans incoming HTTP requests for malicious patterns that match things like SQL injection or XSS attacks. Request Monitoring: It monitors both the headers and the body of requests for suspicious activity. Logging: If it detects a malicious pattern, it logs the details to the console.
To scan a network for malicious activity using JavaScript, you'd typically want to monitor network traffic and log suspicious behaviors. However, JavaScript in the browser is sandboxed and does not have direct access to network interfaces. For network scanning, you'd need to use server-side technologies like Node.js with additional libraries.

Requirements:
Install Node.js from here.
Use a library like net or http to capture and analyze network activity.
Implement pattern detection for common attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
Node.js Script Example:
Create a project directory:

bash
mkdir network-scanner
cd network-scanner
npm init -y
Install the necessary packages:

bash
npm install http net

How to Run:
Save the script as scanner.js.

Run the script:
bash
node scanner.js

The server will start listening on http://localhost:3000. It will log any suspicious activity it detects based on the defined patterns.
Additional Considerations:
This is a simple example. A full network scanner would typically involve packet sniffing (using tools like Wireshark or tcpdump) and would require root privileges or access to network interfaces.
For more robust security analysis, consider integrating Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) like Snort or Suricata.
To monitor specific network interfaces, you would use low-level libraries or tools like libpcap, but these are generally outside JavaScript's capabilities.
